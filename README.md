# Currency Exchange
</br>
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, as it provided me with a fantastic opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in JavaScript. This website serves as a currency converter, allowing users to select the currencies they wish to convert. 
What makes this project particularly special to me is the fact that it was entirely conceived and developed by me. It was a challenge set by my professor, and I embraced it wholeheartedly, creating the entire project from scratch.
This experience not only strengthened my proficiency in JavaScript but also gave me a sense of accomplishment in completing a project of this scale independently.
